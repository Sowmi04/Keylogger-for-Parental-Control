# Keylogger-monitoring-for-parental-control
A Python-based keylogger designed for parental control. This tool is designed to monitor keyboard activities on a computer, detect any 
abusive content, and report such incidents to parents via WhatsApp using the Twilio API. 
The objective is to provide a way for parents to be aware of potentially harmful 
communications involving their children.
